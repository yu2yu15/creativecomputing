<h1>NFT and Art Industry</h1>

#**Introduction**❤<br>
Technology develops so fast these days, and the definition of art is not only paintings or sculptures anymore. People started to break the stereotype that artwork should only appear in museums, and they began to express art in different creative ways, such as digital works or installation art. In this week’s workshop, I learnt that computing could be one kind of art. It is a new perspective for me to think about how technology could affect the development in future.

#**What is NFTs**❤ <br>
NFT stands for the non-fungible token. NFT can let people represent ownership of unique items and tokenise everything, such as artworks, collectables etc. The definition of NFT is they must be irreplaceable, inseparable and unique. For example, everyone could be an NFT, because everyone on the planet is unique and one of a kind. The ability of blockchain technology to assure the unique signature and ownership of NFTs. The fun fact is that nothing can stop people from copying digital arts; the buyer of the NFT can only prove they owned the original piece of artwork. 

#**Nyan Cat Memes**❤<br>
The famous memes’ Nyan Cat’ is an excellent example of NFT artwork. The author of the memes, Chris Torris, remade the memes GIF for its 10th anniversary and put the GIF for a 24hours auction. The GIF finally sold at a price of nearly 580000 US dollars. People can still copy and use the memes even they have already sold them to someone. The buyer only owned the ownership of the GIF but not equal to they could restrict other people to use it. 

#**Async Art**❤<br>
Async Art is a website that allows people to purchase an artwork by parts. They divided the goods as Master and Layers. The owner of the layer can edit the layer they own, and the combination makes unique artworks. The master of the artwork owned the art piece but they could not change the layers. Every change of the artwork is born a new artwork. It is sustainable and gives out a surprise every time someone edits it.

#**Metaverse**❤<br>
The phrase ‘ Metaverse’ might be the trendiest phrase these days. On 28 October, the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerburg, announced that Facebook is changing the company name to ‘Meta’ in order to follow the Metaverse concept. In the idea of Metaverse, the way people surf online should be immersive in the future world. The development of VR, AR and MR will lead the trend of design.

#**Conclusion**❤<br>
The concept of NFT redefined the value of an artwork. The collectors could be not the owner of the actual artwork; instead of only owning the ownership. The NFT could have also become a way to create art by collaborating with the owners, which is a new concept. Although the development of NFT is not mature, I trusted that the idea would affect the art industry and how people value art. The Metaverse concept tells us that art could always be virtual; the definition of art broke the old rules and will become fuzzy.

#**Experiments on Arduino**❤<br>
I am entirely new to the world of coding. Luckily the tutorials online and my friend helped me a lot with the experiment on Arduino. I tried several tests throughout the week.

The attempts are interesting and lead me to the next level of understanding of art and computing. Although I am not a material of coding, the experience taught me about the possibility of myself doing things that I have never done before.

#**To improve and instruction**❤<br>
I still need some time to learn how to code, but the internet helps me understand how to code. Maybe if you are confused about what to do, find some tutorial videos and follow them step by step will definitely help. And friends are the best helper when you need help, do not hesitate to ask your friend to see can they help you throughout the problem confusion. To improve my skill and knowledge with the coding era, I think the best way is to practice more. Practice make perfect.
